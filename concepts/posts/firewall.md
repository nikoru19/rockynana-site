## How Firewalls Work
Firewalls filter network traffic using rules that define what is allowed or blocked. They can operate at different layers, including:

- **Network layer:** Blocks traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.  
- **Application layer:** Filters traffic for specific applications or services.

## Benefits
- Protects networks from unauthorized access  
- Blocks malicious traffic and potential attacks  
- Monitors and logs traffic for security auditing
